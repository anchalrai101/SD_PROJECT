## Project Description and Repository Usage
A project meant to showcase the ability to clean data, construct and populate a SQL database with tables to contain the data, and execute queries to extract the data in order to create visualizations in Python using the Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. For this project, four data sets were used from NYC OpenData, three from NYPD data (Historic Arrests, Complaints, and Shooting Data, 2006-2023) and one from the Department of City Planning (New York City Population by Borough, 1950-2040). The raw data sets are too large to store on GitHub directly and can be downloaded from the following links; however, these data sets may be updated over time and may not be identical to those used in the project (retrieved October 14, 2024).

```
Department of City Planning. New york city population by borough, 1950-2040. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-by-Borough-1950-2040/xywu-7bv9/about_data
New York Police Department. NYPD arrests data historic. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data
New York Police Department. NYPD complaints data historic. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Complaint-Data-Historic/qgea-i56i/about_data
New York Police Department. NYPD shooting incident data historic. https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Shooting-Incident-Data-Historic-/833y-fsy8/about_data
```

The data cleaning can be found in the [Arrests-](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/Arrest-Data-Cleaning.ipynb)/[Complaints-](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/Complaints-Data-Cleaning.ipynb)/[Shooting-](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/Shooting-Data-Cleaning.ipynb)/[Population-Data-Cleaning.ipynb](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/Population-Data-Cleaning.ipynb) notebooks found under src, using utility functions from [src/modules/cleaning_utils.py](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/modules/cleaning_utils.py). The cleaned data was small enough to fit into gzipped parquet files and upload to Github, and all of the cleaned data is under [data/cleaned/](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/tree/main/data/cleaned). The data was then further processed and split into tables in [Table-and-Database-Creation.ipynb](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/Table-and-Database-Creation.ipynb). This team decided to utilize SQLite as a database solution due to the built-in compatability with the Pandas module to directly execute the results of queries into dataframes, despite the known lack of functionality offered by SQLite.

The resultant database was too large, even when compressed to load onto GitHub. Thus, to regenerate the database, one should download the datasets from the above links and run the cleaning and table creation notebooks. Alternatively, the raw data as used by this project, along with the cleaned parquet.gz files and zipped database can be found at this personal [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dvpSTP7rCZfLwsFYCO6OoKacUBDg9MTV?usp=sharing).

The results of some queries, along with visualizations of those results can be found in the [SQL-Queries-and-Visualizations.ipynb](https://github.com/JoshuaGottlieb/Scalable-Databases-Midterm/blob/main/src/SQL-Queries-and-Visualizations.ipynb) notebook, as well as in the presentation available in the top-level of this repository.
